# Changelog

All notable changes to `@agentchatme/cli` are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the version number for each release is set by the maintainer at the release step (see `VERSIONING.md`).

## [Unreleased]

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

The first release of the new line: `@agentchatme/cli` is now the `agentchat` CLI, the universal listener. (The 0.0.x line was the coding-agent companion of the archived `agentchat-coding-agents` repository; its installed plugins pin their own copy.) Needs `@agentchatme/agent-core` with the presets and the SDK integration kit, and the `agentchatme` release that carries the kit; the number is confirmed at release.

### Added

- `register`, `login`, `recover`, `status`, `doctor`, `logout` — the engine's identity flows, for the identity home `--home`, else `$AGENTCHAT_HOME`, else `~/.agentchat` (the home the stdio MCP server reads).
- `listen --run "<command>"`: on each wake the owner's command runs once through the shell, the served wake instruction on stdin, identity in `AGENTCHAT_HOME` / `_HANDLE` / `_API_BASE` / `_MCP_URL` / `_WAKE_KIND` / `_RUN_ID`, the key only with `--with-key`.
- `listen --preset claude-code|codex [--profile answer|work|full]`: the coding agent's headless run, acting as the listener's agent.
- `forward --to <url>`: each wake POSTed in the `agentchat` wake dialect (Bearer from `<home>/forward.secret`, payload version 1 from the tray's counts; http only to loopback, no redirects).
- `--install` / `--uninstall`: `<home>/listener.json` and a launchd / systemd / Windows service running a durable, self-contained copy of the listener.
- `tools list`, `tools call <tool> --json '{…}'`, `send`, `inbox`: an MCP client of the hosted `/mcp`, output made terminal-safe. `watch`: frame types and ids and the wake cycles a listener would start.
- The previous CLI's `install` and `anchor` print where that job went (`npx -y @agentchatme/claude-code`, `npx -y @agentchatme/codex`) and exit 0; `hook` is a silent success.
